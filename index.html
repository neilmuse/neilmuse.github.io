<h1> Favorite CMSC subject so far and why </h1>
    <p> My favorite subject so far is CMSC 130. </p>
    <p> For all of the courses that I took already, </p>
    <p> in this course, I was able to understand its </p>
    <p> application in real life. </p>

<h1>Favorite programming language so far </h1>
    <p> I will consider Java as my favorite language so far </p>
    <p> not because I am good at it but because it is very fulfilling </p>
    <p> to run and see how your code actually runs especially it is moving </p>
    <p> and I can see it with the use of pictures. </p>

<h1> Favorite food </h1>
    <p> I have a lot of favorite food but I think burger is my most favorite food. </p>

<h1> Hobbies </h1>
    <p> Ever since I was a child, I love to write. As I grew older, </p>
    <p> watching series, anime, kdrama and movies becomes a hobby. </p>
    <p> It may sounds weird but cleaning and organizing are also one of my hobbies. </p>

<h1> Childhood dream </h1>
    <p> It was my dream to become a teacher. My parents always remind me how </p>
    <p> important education is and because of it, I want to impart other people knowledge. It is always fun to teach and fulfilling that a person knows more because of you. </p>
